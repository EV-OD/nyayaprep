## Original User Request:
Develop a clean, modern MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) system specifically designed for BALLB preparation classes. The system should allow students to view one question at a time with multiple-choice answers, and provide options such as "Next," "Previous," "Submit," and "Review Answers." Alongside the quiz interface, create a secure admin panel protected by username and password authentication. Through the admin panel, admins must be able to add, edit, delete, and categorize MCQs, as well as manage translations. A key feature should be the inclusion of a Translate button that allows users to switch questions and answers between English and Nepali instantly without reloading the page, ensuring a seamless experience (preferably using technologies like JavaScript or frameworks like React/Vue).

The entire user interface (both for students and admins) must be professional, clean, and mobile-responsive, with a focus on a soft color palette, consistent typography, intuitive navigation, and smooth animations. Incorporate user feedback elements such as loading spinners, success notifications, and confirmation prompts to enhance usability. Additionally, consider implementing features like bulk MCQ upload via CSV and a dark/light theme switcher to improve accessibility and make the platform more efficient for both users and administrators.
